# 🛠️ Crafting Interpreters

A learning project focused on understanding how **interpreters** and **compilers** work under the hood.

## 🎯 Goal

To build a working interpreter from scratch, following along with the book [_Crafting Interpreters_ by Bob Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), and to gain hands-on experience with:

- Designing a programming language
- Parsing and lexing source code
- Implementing syntax trees
- Writing interpreters and virtual machines
- Exploring compiler theory in practice

## 🧠 What I'm Learning

- 📚 Language design and grammar
- 🧾 Tokenization and parsing (Recursive descent)
- 🌳 AST construction and traversal
- ⚙️ Implementing interpreters (tree-walk & bytecode)
- 🧵 Runtime, environments, and closures
- 🧪 Testing and debugging interpreters

## 🚀 Progress

- [x] Scanning (Lexer)
- [x] Parsing (Recursive descent parser)
- [ ] AST & Interpreter
- [ ] Control flow & Environment
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Bytecode VM (optional bonus)
